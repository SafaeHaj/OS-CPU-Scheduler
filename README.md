# OS CPU Scheduler

This repository contains the first assignment for the Operating Systems course, focusing on CPU scheduling algorithms. It includes implementations of:

- First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Round Robin with Priority (RR + Priority)

## Objectives

- Understand and compare scheduling algorithms.
- Implement and simulate their behavior.
- Analyze performance metrics: turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization.
